# Backend Repository

This is the backend repository for our project. It is mainly build with Python and FastAPI.

## Previous Requirements
* Python 3.11.^ - [Python 3.11 Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
* Poetry - [Poetry Download Page](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/)

## Getting Started

You need to install all the dependencies for the project, you can do this with poetry command:

```
$ poetry install
```

Then you can enter the virtual environment created by poetry with:

```
$ poetry shell
```

You can work inside this environment as it has all the dependencies installed.

## Run the server

To run the server locally, you can use uvicorn:

```
$ poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:8000

If you want other devices (such as a mobile phone) to access the API, you can modify the previous command and run it like this:

```
$ poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Check your code

We use Black for format our Python code. To format the code, run the following command:

```
$ poetry run black
```

## Adding dependencies

We use Poetry to manage our dependencies. To add a new dependency, you can use the following command:

```
$ poetry add <dependecy>
```

## Workflow
When you work on your code, we recommend to checkout to "develop" branch:

```
$ git checkout develop
```

And fetch all the changes with git pull:

```
$ git pull
```

Then, you must checkout to your work branch (generated by task):

```
$ git checkout <branch-name>
```

When you are done with your work, we recommend adding the files you modified with the following command:

```
$ git add <filename>
```

Then, you can commit your changes with:

```
$ git commit -m "<commit-message>"
```

>>
**NOTE**: The commit messages should have the following structure: <br>
>*TICBACK-[#]: "[message]"*

Where [#] is the number of the task you are currently working for, and [message] is the actual commit message.

Finally, you can push your changes to your work branch with:

```
$ git push
```

Remember you need to create a Pull Request (PR) once you have pushed your changes and these comply to the GitHub Actions config.
